## Contract Notes

What's different from original?

Looks like this is a "plain-vanilla" token only.
No 5-byte mooncat id or rescue id / order or naming your token etc.

> MISSION IMPURRSABLE
>
> While LaserCats may seem dangerous or unnatural
> compared to their predecessors, we believe them to be equally
> lovable and ready to be saved from further exploitation.

Just a clone?

> Each LaserCat was procedurally generated with
> the use of a forked MoonCat parser and algorithms coded
> from scratch.
>
> Each LaserCat was assigned a tier based on attribute frequency.
> Two headed LaserCats are the rarest of all,
> accounting for the entirety of tiers 1-3.
> Only 1 in 31 LaserCats are two headed.
>
> Approximately 1 in 20 LaserCats developed an ability
> to distort the surrounding fabric of spacetime.
> As you might imagine, this is extremely dangerous.
